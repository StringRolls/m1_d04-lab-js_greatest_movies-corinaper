## Introduction

We have just learned some useful methods, that will help us manipulate **objects and arrays**. In this exercise, we will practice working with these methods, and you are required to use at least one of them in each iteration.

The best way to practice is to work with real data. In the **`src/data.js`** file, you will find an array of info about **the best 250 movies of all times** according to [IMDB Ranking](http://www.imdb.com/chart/top?ref_=nv_mv_250_6) that you will use to display what each iteration asks! :muscle:

<br>

## Requirements

- Fork this repo.
- Clone this repo.
- Practice JavaScript advanced methods (`map`, `reduce`, `filter` and `sort` to manipulate arrays).

<br>

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Solved lab"
$ git push origin master
```

- Create a Pull Request so that your TAs can check your work.

<br>

## Introduction

The `src/data.js` contains an array of 250 movies. It is an array of 250 _objects_ containing the info about each movie. Here is an example of how the data is displayed:

```javascript
{
  "title":"The Shawshank Redemption",
  "year":1994,
  "director":"Frank Darabont",
  "duration":"2h 22min",
  "genre":["Crime","Drama"],
  "score":9.3
}
```



You will be digging deeper into some "facts" that this data set has. For example, we can use this data set to find which is the most popular movie, what is the average duration of the movie, the list of movies by some director, etc. 
Well, there comes your challenge. In the next couple of iterations, you will be using your JS knowledge to manipulate this data.

Remember to read each iteration description carefully before working on the solution.

<br>



## Instructions

You will work on the `src/movies.js` file, which is already loaded in the `index.html` file.

The `src/data.js` file containing the array of movies is also loaded in the `index.html` file.

To run the JavaScript code, open the `index.html` file using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VSCode extension.

To see the output of your JavaScript code, open the [Console in the Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/#console).

### Note about tests

This LAB is equipped with unit tests to provide automated feedback on your lab progress.

**After completing the basic iterations**, go to the **"Test Your Code"** section at the bottom. There you'll be asked to install the testing dependencies and run the tests to check how many tests your code is passing. Once you run the tests, correct your code to pass the failing tests.

<hr>

<br>

### Iteration 1: All directors

We need to get the array of all directors. Since this is a warm up, we will give you a hint: you have to _map_ through the array of movies and get all the directors into one array as a final result. Go ahead and create a function named `getAllDirectors()` that receives an array of movies as an argument and returns a new (_mapped_ array).

<br>

#### Bonus - Iteration 1.1: _Clean_ the array of directors

It seems some of the directors had directed multiple movies so they will pop up multiple times in the array of directors. How could you "clean" a bit this array and make it unified (meaning, without duplicates)? _Don't prioritize the bonus part now, you can come back to it when you are done with the mandatory iterations._ :wink:

<br>

### Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best?

One of the most famous directors in cinema is **[Steven Spielberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg)**, and he has some really awesome drama movies that are on our list, but we want to know how many of them are there.

Go ahead and create a `howManyMovies()` function that receives an array as a parameter and `filter` :eyes: the array so we can have only the **drama** movies where **Steven Spielberg** is the director.

<br>

### Iteration 3: All scores average

These are the best movies based on their scores, so supposedly all of them have a remarkable score. In this iteration, we want to know the average score of all of them and display it on the console. Create a `scoresAverage()` function that receives an array as a parameter and solves the challenge.

The score must be returned rounded to 2 decimals!

**:bulb: Maybe you want to _"reduce"_ the data to a single value. :wink:**

<br>

### Iteration 4: Drama movies

Drama is the genre that repeats the most on our `array`. Apparently, people love drama! :eyes:

Create a `dramaMoviesScore()` function that receives an array as a parameter to get the average score of all drama movies! Let's see if it is better than the general average.

Again, rounded to 2 decimals!

<br>

### Iteration 5: Order by year

We need to sort the movies in ascending order by their release year. This should be easy using one of the **methods** we have just learned. :wink:
Create a function `orderByYear()` that receives an array as parameter and returns a _new sorted array_.

![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ih-materials/uploads/upload_3db351079827c0acba42cf1e397dd8a3.gif)

If two movies have the same year, order them in alphabetical order by their title! :heavy_check_mark:

**:bulb: Make sure not to mutate the original array :wink:**

<br>

### Iteration 6: Alphabetic order

Another popular way to order the movies is to sort them alphabetically using the `title` key. However, in this case, we only need to print the title of the first 20. Easy peasy for an expert like you. :wink:

Create a `orderAlphabetically()` function, that receives an array and returns an array of first 20 titles, alphabetically ordered. Return only the title of each movie, and if the array you receive has less than 20 movies, return all of them.

<br>

### BONUS - Iteration 7: Time format

We get the info from the **IMDB** web page, but the duration info was saved in a format that difficult us a lot to compare movies.

Finding the longest movie is almost impossible using that format, so let's change it!

- Create a `turnHoursToMinutes()` function that receives an array as parameter, and with some _magic_ implemented by you - replaces the duration info of each of the movies for its equivalent in minutes. For example:

```javascript
{
  "title":"The Shawshank Redemption",
  "year":1994,
  "director":"Frank Darabont",
  "duration":"2h 22min",
  "genre":["Crime","Drama"],
  "score":9.3
}
```

Should be:

```javascript
{
  "title":"The Shawshank Redemption",
  "year":1994,
  "director":"Frank Darabont",
  "duration":142,
  "genre":["Crime","Drama"],
  "score":9.3
}
```

**Keep in mind**, you have to return a new array with all the info about movies, meaning, you shouldn't modify the original array.

<br>

### BONUS - Iteration 8: Best yearly score average

We always hear so much about classic movies, but we want to know which year has the best average score, so we can declare the **BEST YEAR FOR CINEMA** officially!

Go ahead and find which year have the best average score for the movies that were released on that year!
Create `bestYearAvg()` function that receives an array of movies and gives us an answer which year was the best year for cinema and what was its average score. The `bestYearAvg()` should return a **string** with the following structure:
<br>

**The best year was \<YEAR\> with an average score of \<RATE\>**

<br>

## Test Your Code

Ohh yes! We have our tests, and you already know how this works. Open your terminal, change directories into the root of the lab, and run `npm install` to install the test runner. Next, run the tests by running the command `npm run test:watch`. 

In summary, the steps are:

```shell
$ cd lab-javascript-greatest-movies
$ npm install
$ npm run test:watch
```

And last, open the generated `lab-solution.html` file with the "Live Server" VSCode extension to see test results.

Remember to focus on one test at a time and read carefully the instructions to understand what you have to do. 

The tests can be found in the `tests/movies.spec.js` file.

**Happy coding!** :heart:
